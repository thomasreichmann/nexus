# Code Patterns

Implementation patterns for the Nexus project.

> [!note] Patterns Not Yet Defined
> The app structure and implementation patterns are not finalized yet. This document will be updated as patterns emerge during development.

## Current Status

The project is in MVP planning phase. Code patterns will be established as we:

1. Set up the initial Next.js project structure
2. Implement the first features
3. Identify patterns that work well

## How Patterns Will Be Added

As development progresses, this document will include:

- Patterns that prove useful and consistent
- Examples extracted from actual working code
- Rationale for why each pattern was chosen

## For Now

When generating code:

- Follow the naming conventions in [[conventions|Conventions]]
- Check existing code for established patterns
- Prefer simple, readable solutions
- Be consistent with what already exists in the codebase
